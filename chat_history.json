Accent colors could be a vibrant orange or yellow to highlight key actions.\n-   Typography: Choose modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for readability.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n\nBecause you mentioned storing information in a database, downloading it as a PDF, and sending emails, you'll need to enable Supabase. Press the Supabase button and connect to a project to get started. You might need to create a project in Supabase first.\n\nHere's a plan to implement the app:\n\n1.  **Create Account Creation and Login Screens:** Implement the UI for account creation and login using the components already available.\n2.  **Implement Flight Information and Passenger Details Input:** Create a form where users can input their flight information and add passengers.\n3.  **Implement Booking Confirmation and My Bookings Page:** Design the UI for booking confirmation and the \"My Bookings\" page.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-17T00:50:08.374846"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a beautiful airport shuttle ride booking app!
